### leds.asm

To test input and output capability of `HACK` we will write an endless loop, in which `HACK` reads the state of the buttons `BUT[1:0]` and writes the result to `LED[1:0]`. All devices for  input and output are mapped to memory addresses starting from 0x1000. The state of `BUT[1:0]` can be read at memory address 4097 and the two leds `LED[1:0]` can be switched on and of by writing to memory address 4096. The Assembler in `tools` already knows the following predefined symbols.

| Symbol          | Value       | Function                                 |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| `LCL`           | 1           | Local segment of VM                      |

| `THIS`          | 3           | Pointer to object in heap                |
| `THAT`          | 4           | Pointer to object in heap                |
| `R0-15`         | 0-15        | Register 0-15                            |
| `LED`           | 4096        | 0 `LED` is off, 1 `LED` is on            |
| `BUT`           | 4097        | 0 `BUT` pushed down, 1 `BUT` released up |
| `UART_TX`       | 4098        | Send byte over UART                      |
| `UART_RX`       | 4099        | Receive byte from UART                   |
| `SPI`           | 4100        | Read/Write to `SPI` flash ROM            |
| `SRAM_A`        | 4101        | Address of SRAM chip for next Read/Write |
| `SRAM_D`        | 4102        | Read/write data from/to SRAM chip        |
| `GO`            | 4103        | Switch from bootloader to SRAM           |
| `LCD8`          | 4104        | Write 8 bits to `LCD`                    |
| `LCD16`         | 4105        | Write 16 bits to `LCD`                   |
| `RTP`           | 4106        | Read/Write 8 bits to `RTP`               |
| `DEBUG0-4`      | 4107-4111   | Reserved for debugging                   |

## mult.asm

To test the `ALU` of `HACK` we will write a little assembler program, that calculates the multiplication of two integers stored in `R0` and `R1`. The result shoud be stored into `R2`.
`
To Test the result we have to load some test values into `R0-2`. After the multiplication is finished we will check the result in `R2`. To show if the multiplication is correct, we use two strategies:

#### Use LED to debug

To test `mult.asm` on real hardware, we can use the `LED[1:0]` to display if the result is correct or wrong according to:

| LED[1:0] | output               |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| 00       | nothing happened yet |
| 01       | start multiplication |
| 10       | correct result       |
| 11       | wrong result         |

### Use DEBUG0-4 register

To test `mult.asm` in simulation, we can use the `DEBUG` registers. Every time we change the value of `R0-2` we store the new values also to the corresponding register `DEBUG0-2`. This is done by replacing every instance of a code snippet that changes `R1` (and `R0/R2` accordingly):

```
@R1
M=<new value>
```

With the code that additionally writes the new value to the `DEBUG1` register:

```
@R1
DM=<new value>
@DEBUG1
M=D
```

### Project

* Implement `leds.asm`  and `mult.asm`.

* Put your code in the skeleton file `<filename>.asm`. To build the `.hack` binary file, which can than be preloaded to the instruction ROM of `HACK` in `05_Computer_Architecture/04_HACK`, just type:
  
  ```sh
  $ make leds
  ```
  
  or
  
  ```sh
  $ make mult
  ```
  
  This will invoke the assembler and copy the produced binary file `ROM.hack` in the appropriate folder `05_Computer_Architecture/04_HACK`.

* To run the programms you first have to build a `HACK` computer. This is done in `05_Computer_Architecture`.
